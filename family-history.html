      <h1>From Ulster to Rocky Spring: The Story of John Wead</h1>

      <h2>Scots‑Irish Roots and a New Life in Pennsylvania</h2>
      <p>
        Born 1710 in County Cavan, Ireland, John Wead (Wade) was part of the
        Scots‑Irish Presbyterian migration that brought determined Ulster
        families to colonial America. He arrived in Pennsylvania between 1728
        and 1730. This date range is drawn from the timing of his 1738 land
        warrant and aligns with the larger wave of Ulster Scots immigration into
        the region during those years. John followed a familiar migration path
        through Chester and Lancaster before pushing west into the unsettled
        Cumberland Valley. In 1738, he secured a Pennsylvania land warrant for
        200 acres near the confluence of Falling Spring and the
        Conococheague—then a rugged frontier zone. His tract lay just north of
        Benjamin Chambers’s mill and bordered the properties of early neighbors
        like William Kelso and James Gay. By carving out a homestead there, John
        stood among the earliest settlers of what would become Letterkenny
        Township. He helped build both farm and fellowship, anchoring a
        Scots-Irish community that would thrive for generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the <em>French &amp; Indian War</em> (1754–63) spilled into the
        Cumberland Valley, the Wade homestead sat on the very line of danger. In
        November 1755, Shawnee and Lenape warriors struck the settlements west
        of Rocky Spring in the <strong>Great Cove massacre</strong>—burning
        cabins only a day’s ride from John Wade’s farm and carrying off dozens
        of neighbors as prisoners. Raids continued down the Conococheague
        frontier through 1756, forcing many families to abandon their claims and
        crowd into makeshift stockades; Rocky Spring itself was fortified with a
        log “fort meeting-house” during the crisis.

        Cumberland Valley, the Wade homestead sat on the very line of danger. In
        November 1755, Shawnee and Lenape warriors struck the settlements west
        of Rocky Spring in the <strong>Great Cove massacre</strong>—burning
        cabins only a day’s ride from John Wade’s farm and carrying off dozens
        of neighbors as prisoners. Raids continued down the Conococheague
        frontier through 1756, forcing many families to abandon their claims and
        crowd into makeshift stockades; Rocky Spring itself was fortified with a
        log “fort meeting-house” during the crisis.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this climate of panic—rifle shots at night, alarms from Fort Loudoun,
        and rumors that even church elders were taken captive—John Wade enlisted
        in the
        <strong>Pennsylvania Provincial Troops</strong>. Muster rolls place him
        on active duty in 1758‑59, the years of Forbes’s march toward
        Fort Duquesne. Whether he was ever wounded or briefly captured is
        unknown, but his own 1789 will later claims “the
        <em>arrears of pay due me for the Expedition</em>,” confirming both
        service and long‑overdue wages.
      </p>

      <p>
        The threat was so acute that in <strong>February 1760</strong>—with
        militia patrols thin and rumors of a renewed assault—John drafted his
        first will. It conveyed his “<em>plantation near Rocky Spring</em>” to
        his seventeen‑year‑old son <strong>Ebenezer</strong> and provided cash
        legacies and livestock for daughters
        <strong>Fanny, Elizabeth,</strong> and <strong>Mary</strong>. He also
        ordered that his <em>musket, rifle, and powder horn</em> were never to
        be sold outside the family, a sober reminder that firearms were both
        livelihood and lifeline on the far frontier. In a single document we
        glimpse a father’s resolve to secure his children’s future, even as war,
        disease, and displacement stalked the Falling Spring settlement.
      </p>

      <h2>Homestead Legacy: From Warrant to Community</h2>
      <p>
        John's decision to prepare his estate bore fruit. In 1765, his son
        Ebenezer received a formal land warrant from the Proprietary government,
        confirming improvements made decades earlier by "John Waid, father of
        said Ebenezer." This wasn’t just a legal formality—it recognized the
        family's right to nearly 480 acres shaped by John’s early labor. The
        Wead homestead encompassed fields, woodlots, and springs in an area that
        became a hub of Scots-Irish settlement. It stood near the Rocky Spring
        Presbyterian meetinghouse and bordered farms owned by the Culbertsons,
        Andersons, and Boyds—families tied together by marriage, kinship, and
        shared faith. John’s choice of land and his long residence there
        reflected not only persistence but quiet leadership. His presence helped
        transform a contested edge of empire into a rooted community.

          church was built in 1738, possibly on land given by John Wead. The
          present stone structure was erected in 1794 by Walter Beatty. During
          the Revolutionary War, Rev. John Craighead inspired many to join the
          Continental Army from this pulpit. The congregation disbanded in 1898,
          and since 1919, the Franklin County Chapter DAR has cared for the
          church and cemetery, purchasing the property in 2007.

      <h2>Later Years, Faith, and Family</h2>
      <p>
        John Wead remained on the land for the rest of his life. In tax rolls
        from the 1780s, he appears as a stable landholder with domestic help,
        suggesting ongoing productivity and community standing. His faith never
        wavered. When Rocky Spring Presbyterian Church formally organized in the
        1780s, John was already a regular at the log meeting house. An inventory
        after his death revealed a personal library of theological
        works—Westminster Confession, volumes of sermons, and Robert Wodrow’s
        <em>History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland</em>—showing
        both his literacy and deep Presbyterian conviction. In 1789, just months
        before his death, he drafted a new will. This final testament provided
        for his wife Janet (née Gabby), left gifts to his grandson John
        McConnell and nephew William Gabby, and notably remembered his brother
        William Wead of Bailieborough, County Cavan—a rare and precious
        transatlantic genealogical link.
      </p>

      <h2>A Well-Provisioned Man of Principle</h2>
      <p>
        When John Wead died in 1790, he left behind more than 200 acres of
        improved land, a herd of livestock, and a home well-stocked with tools,
        furniture, and religious books. His personal inventory included nearly
        two dozen cows and heifers, over 100 sheep, and a wagon, suggesting he
        ran a productive, self-sufficient farm. Yet nothing in his estate was
        extravagant—every item, from a dung fork to a family Bible, reflected
        utility and conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
        His library was steeped in theology and Scottish history. Titles like
        <em>The Confession of Faith</em> and
        <em>Wodrow’s History of the Church of Scotland</em> reveal a man who
        lived—and taught—his Presbyterian values. He was literate, devout, and
        trusted by his community. His wife Janet, three decades his junior, was
        not only his final spouse but one of two executors of his estate. The
        other? His neighbor and friend James McConnell.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was no solitary farmer. This was a man respected by neighbors,
        remembered in Ireland, and loved by family.
      </p>

      <h2>From Pennsylvania to the Western Frontier: A Lasting Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        John Wead died on January 17, 1790, at the age of 79, and was buried in
        the Rocky Spring cemetery he helped settle more than 50 years earlier.
        But his story didn’t end there. In the following decade, his descendants
        joined the wave of westward migration. Ebenezer Wead and his family
        moved to Kentucky in the 1790s and later crossed into the Ohio frontier,
        establishing roots near Dayton. There, the Weads built new homes,
        founded churches, and petitioned authorities for security as the young
        republic expanded. Ebenezer lived until 1830, bridging the colonial
        frontier and early Ohio statehood. Through each chapter, John’s
        descendants carried his values—faith, hard work, land stewardship, and
        readiness to defend home.
      </p>
      <p>
        A musket once held on a rocky Pennsylvania hillside may have ridden in a
        wagon across the Alleghenies, a silent heirloom of courage and
        conviction. Today, John Wead’s legacy endures as a powerful emblem of
        the Scots-Irish American experience—a tale of grit, grace, and
        generational endurance.
