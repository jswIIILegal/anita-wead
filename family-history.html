      <h2>Act I: Colonial Roots &amp; A Father’s Will (1760s)</h2>
      <p>The Wead story begins on the edges of colonial Pennsylvania.
        In 1760, family patriarch John Waid drafted a will that
        intertwined land, duty and heritage.  He bequeathed his
        plantation and homestead to his sons and directed that his
        arms &mdash; a musket and rifle &mdash; remain in the family
        for defence.  The document exhorted his heirs to maintain
        the land and stand ready for military service when called.  It
        captures the fusion of landownership, responsibility and
        patriotism that would define the family’s identity.</p>

      <h2>Act II: A Teenager’s Land Warrant (1765)</h2>
      <p>Only five years later, seventeen‑year‑old <strong>Ebenezer
        Wead</strong> secured a proprietary land warrant for 200 acres in
        Letterkenny Township.  The warrant, issued on 24&nbsp;May&nbsp;1765
        by the Penn proprietors, required payment of “current
        Money of this Province… and a yearly quit‑rent of one penny
        sterling for every acre.”  That a teenager
        could stake claim to frontier land suggests ambition,
        family support or both.  It foreshadows the restless
        mobility that would carry the Weads westward.</p>

      <h2>Act III: Westward Bound (1790s)</h2>
      <p>By the 1790s, the Weads joined the waves of Americans
        migrating west.  They left Pennsylvania for Lexington,
        Kentucky, where sons learned trades and married, then moved
        again.  In 1798&nbsp;–&nbsp;1799, they crossed the Ohio River and
        entered fractional Section&nbsp;24 in Van Buren Township, just
        south of the nascent town of Dayton.  Here
        they carved farms from wilderness, helped found churches and
        petitioned for protection during the turbulent Indian wars.
        Ebenezer’s life thus bridged colonial Pennsylvania and the
        young republic’s western frontier.</p>

      <h2>Act IV: The Art &amp; Mystery of Weaving (1802)</h2>
      <p>On 14&nbsp;February&nbsp;1802, a contract bound
        <em>Ebenezer Wead&nbsp;Jr.</em> to learn the “art and mystery of
        weaving” from William&nbsp;Orr.  The apprenticeship called for
        payment of a cow and fifty dollars, reflecting the value of
        skilled textile work.  Yet the young apprentice departed “without
        reasonable cause,” absenting himself for 18&nbsp;months.  When
        Orr sued, the court dismissed his claim and ordered him to
        pay the Weads’ court costs.  The episode reveals both the
        family’s engagement in craft trades and their willingness to
        defend their interests.</p>

    <section class="act">
      <h2>Act V: Service &amp; Settlement (1812–1830s)</h2>
      <p>The next generation carried forward the twin threads of
        service and settlement.  <strong>James&nbsp;Wead</strong>, born in 1790,
        served first in the Ohio militia and then in the U.S. Army
        during the War of 1812.  Congress rewarded his and his
        brother’s service with bounty land patents in the Illinois
        Military Tract, although clerks mis‑spelled their names as
        “Wade” and “Wood.”  Back in Ohio, the
        Weads’ farms flourished; they appear in local church and
        courthouse records as plaintiffs, defendants, jurors and
        neighbors.  By the 1830s, patriarch Ebenezer’s will would
        distribute farms, tools and a lifetime of frontier
        accumulation to his children and grandchildren, ensuring the
        family’s legacy endured.</p>

      <h2>Epilogue: A Legacy Etched in Land</h2>
      <p>From a father’s 1760 injunction to defend home and
        country, through a teenager’s bold land warrant and a young
        man’s aborted weaving apprenticeship, to soldiers’ bounty
        land grants, the Wead story is woven into the American
        frontier.  The documents and memories preserved here offer
        just a few scenes in a cinematic narrative stretching across
        centuries.</p>
