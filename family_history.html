      <h2>Scots‑Irish Roots and a New Life in Pennsylvania</h2>
      <p>Born around 1710 in County Cavan, Ireland, John Wead was part of the Scots‑Irish Presbyterian migration that brought hardworking Ulster families to the American colonies. By the 1750s he had journeyed to Pennsylvania seeking opportunity and religious freedom. He settled near a spring north of Chambersburg in what was then Cumberland County, carving a farm out of the wilderness of Letterkenny Township. Life on the Pennsylvania frontier was perilous—colonists cleared dense forests, built log cabins, tilled new fields and defended themselves from French‑allied raids during the French and Indian War. Together with his neighbors, John helped build a community around Rocky Spring, laying the foundation for a lasting settlement.</p>

      <h2>Frontier Service and a Father’s Will</h2>
      <p>When war reached Pennsylvania in the 1750s, John joined the Pennsylvania Provincial Troops to protect the Cumberland Valley. Frontier service took its toll—settlers’ homes were burned, families fled to forts, and back pay for militia service was slow to arrive. Perhaps mindful of these uncertainties, John wrote his first will in 1760. He bequeathed his “plantation” near Rocky Spring to his teenage son Ebenezer, ensuring the land would remain in family hands. His daughters Fanny, Elizabeth and Mary received monetary legacies, and he acknowledged step‑children from his second marriage. In a telling detail, John directed that his musket and rifle stay within the family. For a frontier homesteader, a firearm was both a tool and a symbol of self‑reliance, underscoring his values of preparedness, duty and protection.</p>

      <h2>Homestead Legacy: From Warrant to Community</h2>
      <p>John’s foresight soon bore fruit. In May 1765 his son Ebenezer obtained a land warrant for approximately 479 acres encompassing the Rocky Spring homestead. The patent noted that the land covered “an improvement made by John Waid (Wead), the father of said Ebenezer,” formalizing a claim that John had earned through years of hard labor. Early settlers often squatted on and improved land before obtaining title; by securing the warrant, John ensured his toil became a lasting legacy. The Wead plantation abutted the tracts of neighbors like the Culbertsons, Boyds and Breckenridges and soon included the Rocky Spring meetinghouse. The homestead became an anchor property in Letterkenny, demonstrating John’s leadership in transforming a piece of wilderness into a thriving Scots‑Irish farming community.</p>

      <h2>Later Years, Faith, and Family</h2>
      <p>John lived to see the American colonies win their independence. Tax lists from the 1780s still recorded him as a landowner with servants, a testament to a productive farm and a patriarchal presence on the frontier. Faith remained central to his life; Rocky Spring’s Presbyterian congregation was formally organized around 1780, and an inventory of his estate would later reveal numerous religious books. In 1789, nearly three decades after his first will, John drafted a new testament. By then his daughters were grown, his son established, and he had remarried. The will provided generously for his second wife Janet (Gabby) Wead, named his grandson John McConnell and even remembered his brother William back in Bailieborough, County Cavan. Longtime neighbors James and Nathaniel Mitchell and Christian Grove witnessed the document, reflecting the close-knit nature of the community he helped build. John died in January 1790 around the age of eighty and was buried in the Rocky Spring Church cemetery—ground he had helped settle decades earlier.</p>

      <h2>From Pennsylvania to the Western Frontier: John Wead’s Lasting Legacy</h2>
      <p>John’s legacy did not end at Rocky Spring. Like many Americans after the Revolution, his descendants joined the westward migration. In the 1790s Ebenezer Wead and his family moved to Kentucky, where his sons learned trades and started families. By 1798 they crossed the Ohio River into the Northwest Territory, claiming land in Greene and Montgomery counties near the fledgling town of Dayton. On this new frontier they built farms from scratch, hewed churches out of the wilderness and petitioned authorities for protection during unrest. Ebenezer lived until 1830, his life spanning from the colonial era through the formation of Ohio statehood. As the Weads pressed westward they carried John’s values—faith, attachment to land, hard work and readiness to serve—into the developing heartland. His musket may well have traveled in a wagon across the Appalachians, a symbol of both protection and patriotism. Today John’s story stands as a vivid example of the Scots‑Irish American experience: a man who crossed an ocean, defended his home and planted roots so deep that his family tree spread across a continent.</p>
