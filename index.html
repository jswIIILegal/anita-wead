    This page has been updated to move the résumé section above the A.N.I.T.A.
    gallery and to add a simple password gate on the photo grid.  When the
    Coming Soon section is expanded the visitor will be asked for a password
    ("felicita") before the pictures are revealed.  The toggle and
    password‑check logic lives in the embedded script below.

    Technical &amp; Investigative Development
    Independent Researcher &amp; System Architect — July 2024 – Present
    Began developing investigative tools and legal automation frameworks in mid-2024 through manual research, public records analysis, and document mapping — later evolving the project into a full-stack AI-powered system known as anita (Automated Network for Investigative and Technical Analysis).
    Built a proprietary forensic pipeline to flag financial misconduct, trace shell companies, and surface retaliation patterns across 86,000+ records.
    Transitioned from traditional research to AI-based analysis in early 2024, leveraging FastAPI, Python, GitHub Copilot, and JSON schema design to automate previously manual workflows.
    Delivered litigation-grade reports valued at over $600K in equivalent consulting output — supporting active cases and regulatory referrals (HUD, IDFPR, FIRREA).
    Integrated OCR, metadata indexing, FOIA relevance scoring, and RICO predicate chain detection into a modular architecture anchored in clean, reproducible code.
    Continuously refined the system with legal logic models and deep-link search capabilities, connected to Notion for collaborative case intelligence.

    Design/Build Manager &amp; Lead Project Manager — T.A. Bowman Constructors (Bloomingdale, IL) — March 2021 – June 2024
    Managed a $4.4M+ fire restoration of the Bay Marine boat facility in Waukegan, IL, from initial disaster response through final occupancy – coordinated 10+ change orders, specialty sub-trades, and code upgrade solutions.
    Designed a Walmart Distribution Center structure in Auburn, IN and oversaw complete building envelope installation using Metl-Span insulated panels with advanced vapor barrier detailing for climate control.
    Won a national Nucor CAD design challenge (2024) for the most cost-efficient, code-compliant pre-engineered metal building design. Introduced an innovative insulated roof deck system (OneDek) on a Boys &amp; Girls Club retrofit, which became a showcase project for the manufacturer.

    Sales Executive — Midwest Territory — KMK Sales (Manufacturer Rep) (Midwest U.S.) — 2018 – 2021
    Exclusive Midwest representative for leading building envelope products (Metl-Span IMPs, Jamison cold-storage doors, Vapor Armor barriers, Dow foam insulation, etc.), covering IL, MN, WI, IA, ND, SD (and CO).
    Conducted detailed take-offs, estimates, and on-site trainings for contractors on insulated panel systems – addressing thermal bridging, air seals, and installation best practices.
    Built a full general contractor target list by state from scratch, and drove specification of IMP solutions in high-profile projects (e.g. supported Metl-Span's award-winning Confluence Center project) to ensure technical alignment and on-site success.

    Outside Sales Consultant — Culligan Water (Greater Chicago Area) — 2008 – 2018
    Consistently top-performing sales representative (multiple regional awards, incl. "Tidal Wave" and Top Sales honors) for residential and commercial water treatment systems.
    Built a loyal client base through trust and integrity – known as the "Culligan Man" trusted by homeowners and facilities managers; maintained relationships and referral business years after the initial sale.
    Featured in the national "Your Healthy Home" TV segment as a model Culligan consultant, reinforcing credibility and customer confidence.
    Led Sales Excellence for Culligan: Earned numerous national and regional awards including multiple "Tidal Wave" honors. Participated in corporate-sponsored commercial training walk-throughs to demonstrate best practices. Represented the company in the territory containing Culligan's historic corporate headquarters (established 1936 in Rosemont, IL).

    Sales Representative — Bob Rohrman Auto Group (Jeep/Chrysler) (Palatine, IL) — 2007 – 2008
    Achieved high quarterly vehicle sales in a fast-paced retail environment by focusing on customer needs and product knowledge, leading to repeat customer referrals and sustained revenue growth.

    Inside Sales (Rookie of the Year) — International Profit Associates (IPA) (Buffalo Grove, IL) — 2005 – 2007
    Awarded Rookie of the Year in 2006 for generating $3.2M in consulting revenue through high-volume cold calling and consultative selling to SMB clients.

    Sales Technician / Crew Lead — Stanley Steemer (Palatine, IL) — 1999 – 2005
    Rose from technician to crew lead while consistently ranking as a top sales performer in service upsells (twice earning a national Indy 500 award trip).
    Trained and mentored new technicians in both equipment operation and customer service excellence.

    Technical Projects &amp; Investigative Research
    Founder &amp; Lead Developer – "anita" Investigative Platform (Independent Project, 2024 – Present)
    Sole architect of anita (Automated Network for Investigative and Technical Analysis) – a proprietary legal forensics and document-intelligence platform designed to expose misconduct, financial fraud, and retaliation patterns across large datasets. Built a full-stack Python architecture (FastAPI, Pydantic) with modular pipelines for OCR processing, shell-entity detection, statutory triggers (FOIA, RICO), and timeline mapping.
    Ingested and analyzed 86,000+ records with custom JSON schemas and cross-document search capabilities. Engineered automation for metadata tagging, semantic duplicate detection, and entity resolution to reverse-engineer complex financial transactions and shell company networks.
    Produced litigation-ready investigative reports (comparable to $600K+ of consulting work) by developing this system end-to-end in under 90 days. Deliverables have supported formal complaints and evidentiary packages for HUD, state regulators, and the Illinois Attorney General.
    Leveraged GitHub Copilot and agile trial-and-error development to rapidly iterate on features. Integrated outputs with Notion for case knowledge management and maintained rigorous data integrity through version-controlled pipelines and document indexing best practices.
