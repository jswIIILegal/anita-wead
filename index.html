Technical & Investigative Development
Independent Researcher & System Architect — July 2024 – Present
Began developing investigative tools and legal automation frameworks in mid-2024 through manual research, public records analysis, and document mapping — later evolving the project into a full-stack AI-powered system known as anita (Automated Network for Investigative and Technical Analysis).
Built a proprietary forensic pipeline to flag financial misconduct, trace shell companies, and surface retaliation patterns across 86,000+ records.
Transitioned from traditional research to AI-based analysis in early 2024, leveraging FastAPI, Python, GitHub Copilot, and JSON schema design to automate previously manual workflows.
Delivered litigation-grade reports valued at over $600K in equivalent consulting output — supporting active cases and regulatory referrals (HUD, IDFPR, FIRREA).
Integrated OCR, metadata indexing, FOIA relevance scoring, and RICO predicate chain detection into a modular architecture anchored in clean, reproducible code.
Continuously refined the system with legal logic models and deep-link search capabilities, connected to Notion for collaborative case intelligence.

Design/Build Manager & Lead Project Manager — T.A. Bowman Constructors (Bloomingdale, IL) — March 2021 – June 2024
Managed a $4.4M+ fire restoration of the Bay Marine boat facility in Waukegan, IL, from initial disaster response through final occupancy – coordinated 10+ change orders, specialty sub-trades, and code upgrade solutions.
Designed a Walmart Distribution Center structure in Auburn, IN and oversaw complete building envelope installation using Metl-Span insulated panels with advanced vapor barrier detailing for climate control.
Won a national Nucor CAD design challenge (2024) for the most cost-efficient, code-compliant pre-engineered metal building design. Introduced an innovative insulated roof deck system (OneDek) on a Boys & Girls Club retrofit, which became a showcase project for the manufacturer.

Sales Executive — Midwest Territory — KMK Sales (Manufacturer Rep) (Midwest U.S.) — 2018 – 2021
Exclusive Midwest representative for leading building envelope products (Metl-Span IMPs, Jamison cold-storage doors, Vapor Armor barriers, Dow foam insulation, etc.), covering IL, MN, WI, IA, ND, SD (and CO).
Conducted detailed take-offs, estimates, and on-site trainings for contractors on insulated panel systems – addressing thermal bridging, air seals, and installation best practices.
Built a full general contractor target list by state from scratch, and drove specification of IMP solutions in high-profile projects (e.g. supported Metl-Span's award-winning Confluence Center project) to ensure technical alignment and on-site success.

Outside Sales Consultant — Culligan Water (Greater Chicago Area) — 2008 – 2018
Consistently top-performing sales representative (multiple regional awards, incl. "Tidal Wave" and Top Sales honors) for residential and commercial water treatment systems.
Built a loyal client base through trust and integrity – known as the "Culligan Man" trusted by homeowners and facilities managers; maintained relationships and referral business years after the initial sale.
Featured in the national "Your Healthy Home" TV segment as a model Culligan consultant, reinforcing credibility and customer confidence.
Led Sales Excellence for Culligan: Earned numerous national and regional awards including multiple "Tidal Wave" honors. Participated in corporate-sponsored commercial training walk-throughs to demonstrate best practices. Represented the company in the territory containing Culligan's historic corporate headquarters (established 1936 in Rosemont, IL).

Trained and mentored new technicians in both equipment operation and customer service excellence.

Technical Projects & Investigative Research
Founder & Lead Developer – "anita" Investigative Platform (Independent Project, 2024 – Present)
Sole architect of anita (Automated Network for Investigative and Technical Analysis) – a proprietary legal forensics and document-intelligence platform designed to expose misconduct, financial fraud, and retaliation patterns across large datasets. Built a full-stack Python architecture (FastAPI, Pydantic) with modular pipelines for OCR processing, shell-entity detection, statutory triggers (FOIA, RICO), and timeline mapping.
Ingested and analyzed 86,000+ records with custom JSON schemas and cross-document search capabilities. Engineered automation for metadata tagging, semantic duplicate detection, and entity resolution to reverse-engineer complex financial transactions and shell company networks.
Produced litigation-ready investigative reports (comparable to $600K+ of consulting work) by developing this system end-to-end in under 90 days. Deliverables have supported formal complaints and evidentiary packages for HUD, state regulators, and the Illinois Attorney General.
Leveraged GitHub Copilot and agile trial-and-error development to rapidly iterate on features. Integrated outputs with Notion for case knowledge management and maintained rigorous data integrity through version-controlled pipelines and document indexing best practices.
